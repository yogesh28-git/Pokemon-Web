                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Starter Pokémon (also known as first partner Pokémon) is a terminology concept that refers to Pokémon
                    that the
                    player must choose between in the beginning of each Pokémon video game. These Pokémon are rare in
                    the wild and
                    entrusted to certain Pokémon Professors by the Pokémon League, with a set number to be given out to
                    starting
                    Pokémon Trainers ages ten and older once a year along with a Pokémon Trainer's License at the
                    professor's
                    laboratory. While it's not explicitly required in-universe that a new trainer obtains a starter
                    Pokémon as their
                    first it's generally recommended as these Pokémon are generally easier to care for and raise. There
                    are always
                    three Pokémon to choose between. One will be a Water type, another one Grass, and the last one Fire
                    (excluding
                    Pikachu and Eevee in Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition and Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and
                    Let's Go, Eevee!
                    respectively). The three types create a circle, where each Pokémon is weak to one of the others and
                    strong to
                    the other one. In the games, the player's rival always chooses the Pokémon with a type advantage
                    (disadvantage
                    from Sun and Moon onwards) over the player's Pokémon. Pokémon Legends: Arceus have their starters
                    come from
                    different generations and their final evolved forms have Regional forms.</p>

                    <h3 id="theme-song">Theme Song</h3>
                    <p>This is the nostagic song from the first season of Pokeon</p>

                    <p>"Pokémon Theme" (also known as "Gotta catch ’em all!") is a song written by John Siegler and John
                        Loeffler and performed by Jason Paige. It is the original theme song for the first season of the
                        English adaptation of the Pokémon anime. Since its release, the song has been virtually
                        synonymous
                        with the Pokémon franchise because the line "Gotta catch ’em all!" has become its official
                        English
                        slogan; it is derived from the Japanese.</p>

                    <p>"Pokémon Theme" is a fast-paced pop rock song with continuous male vocals intermixed with backup
                        vocal accompaniment that also sings the chorus: "Pokémon! (Gotta catch ’em all!").</p>
